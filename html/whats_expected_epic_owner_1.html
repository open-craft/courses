 As an
 <strong>epic owner</strong>:
</p>
<ol>
 <li>
  <p>
   I will keep clients updated on the status of tickets
   (for clients with long term monthly contracts, this means updating
   their JIRA or Trello boards as work progresses).
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   I will create tickets on OpenCraft's JIRA board for upcoming work,
   and place them into the appropriate upcoming sprints
   so that we can get the work done well ahead of applicable deadlines.
  </p>

   On Friday and Monday, before the planning meeting, I will assign
   upcoming stories from this epic that need to be done next sprint
   to myself - or I will ask others from the relevant subteam
   to be either the assignee or the reviewer.
