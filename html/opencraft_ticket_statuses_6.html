<p>
  <strong>External Review/Blocked</strong>:
  Finished tasks with an upstream pull request, or tasks
  that are waiting on something (like a code review) from anyone outside of OpenCraft.
</p>
<p>
  Ideally, all Pull Requests should reach this state ahead of the end of the week
  to leave time for reviewing and corrections.
  <br />
  These tasks are usually awaiting the owner of an upstream repo to review
  and merge the changes. This external reviewer is often another team at edX or a client.
  <br />
  If the one who does the merge is from within the OpenCraft team,
  he can move the task forward. Otherwise, you should regularly check
  if the PR is merged, and move it yourself.
  <br />
  If you (the assignee) do not expect any progress on the ticket
  in the upcoming sprint, you should move the ticket to the
  "Long External Review/Blocked" sprint, so that it won't be cluttering up the
  weekly sprint board and so that your commitments for the upcoming sprint are
  more certain.
