  As you are getting familiar with OpenCraft's culture and way of
  working, it also a good time to pass on a bit of wisdom, from other team members
  who have been in your situation before. The on-boarding can take a lot of
  effort, and can be somewhat overwehlming at times. So if you ever find yourself
  doubting your ability to make it, don't forget that it takes time for everyone
  to learn the ropes during the first months, and it's expected that it will
  consume part of your time on tasks. Don't be afraid to account for this!

   We all felt like impostors at first

  The hour tracking won't be used against you. It's used to bill clients
  and ensure we stay within project budgets, not to monitor individual
  performance. Log all the hours, even if they don't feel legitimate - or
  you are going to resent it in the long term.
  Also, clients don't see the individual log messages.

  Individual performance is actually measured on elements like communication,
  anticipation of blockers, finding solutions within the given timeframes, asking
  for help, etc. At first, it can look useless or even spammy to just drop small
  replies onto issues, out of fear of wasting other people's time. But even the
  little, "Yes, thank you, I hear you" messages are important, and help keep the
  lines open.

 Some quotes from other team members:

  I partially thought [worklogs] were in place to specifically be used against me.
  It took me some time to fully come to terms with the hourly stuff.
  Most of the guilt/frustration went away the more I:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Trusted this stuff wasn't being used against me.
  </li>
  <li>
   Saw that other people on the team struggling with tech stuff and spillover
   like I was - I think it's important to figure out what "normal" really is
   on a team. It's not usually the superhuman thing one thinks it is initially.

  I also struggled with communication on tasks. I'd find myself buried
  under days of pain before I came up for air and declared defeat,
  instead of reaching out early with questions. It's hard to ask for help,
  and even harder when you haven't met the people, and every word
  is indelibly printed on the page.

  I docked my hours when I felt like my struggles were the fault
  of my own incompetence, and resented the job for "making" me do it.
  I viewed the OpenCraft team members as superhuman &#8212;
  the amount of work you guys get done, and how quickly and well you do it?
  Freaking amazing. The level of scrutiny performed on even the smallest ticket,
  and the quality of the code we produce, is incredible. I've never even
  had a job where my code was reviewed, let alone criticised line by line, and
  definitely not on public, open-source websites. Initially, when I started this
  job, I'd have to take a deep breath before replying with a "thank you for
  spotting that!", but now, I love seeing how clean the resulting code is once
  it's been through our wringer. I'm proud of what I create, and prouder now when
  it survives the reviews. But that took time.
