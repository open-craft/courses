<p>To request time off please:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Make sure to book holidays from two weeks in advance (for a few days) to a month (for 1+ weeks).
  </li>
  <li>
    Check the <a href="https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=auscaqbrvc0uatk6e7126614kk%40group.calendar.google.com" target="_blank">team calendar</a> first to see if anyone else has booked those dates off - we try to avoid having more than two people on vacation at the same time.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you decide to travel and still work, it's useful to let Xavier know. As long as you have a good internet connection and maintain work hours and communication / reactivity levels, you can work from anywhere.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you are going to take vacation and still work with reduced hours, the above applies, along with notification of your estimated amount of work. Also, add your name and an indication of reduced hours for the time period it applies to on the OpenCraft calendar.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you are a developer:
    <ol>
      <li>
        Check if you need to make any trades on the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ix68BsU2hJ2ikexXWeBcqFysfoF4l7IKRghIDQgyfPs/edit#gid=447257869" target="_blank">rotations schedule</a> and if so, get tentative agreement from someone to trade with you.
      </li>
      <li>
        For all subteams other than Small Projects: find someone from the Small Projects team who agrees to cover for your time commitments on each of your subteams.
        <ul>
          <li>You can ping all the members of the Small Projects subteam and let them choose, and each member will know whether they can cover each specific topic.</li>
          <li>Ping them in a JIRA epic you need to cover (preferably pick an epic where there are already many members of the Small Projects subteam, or else in any epic of the subteam you need to cover), or in chat if you require a faster response.</li>
          <li>It can make sense both to have someone who has already been in that subteam, as well as to onboard someone new.</li>
          <li>Rather than waiting for all answers, you can accept the first offer.</li>
          <li>If there's any doubt or not enough responses, you can bring it up with Braden and Xavier.</li>
          <li>If subteam assignments for next month change and it affects the covering, bring it up to find another option. E.g. if the person who covered hours isn't anymore in the Small Projects subteam, or if the covered person doesn't need to cover the agreed subteam anymore but a different one.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Make sure that the epic reviewer for any epic you own is going to be present and is fully informed so they can take over the epic owner duties while you are away.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Email Xavier to ask him to confirm your time off.
  </li>
  <li>
    Before leaving for vacation, make sure to set a vacation responder
    indicating dates you will be unavailable and an alternative person and / or
    email to contact in case of urgency (notify the person(s) covering for you).
    Remember to turn the responder off once back to work! Please find instructions
    on how to do it <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/25922?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">here</a>.
