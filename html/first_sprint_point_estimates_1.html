<p>
  Please participate in the grooming session (point estimation) that
  the team does at the end of each sprint.
  Usually you should get an email about this and can follow the link
  to reach the estimation page, but if not, try
  <a href="https://tasks.opencraft.com/projects/OC?selectedItem=com.spartez.jira.plugins.jiraplanningpoker:pokerng-project-side-panel-link&amp;rapidView=5&amp;source=sidebar" target="_blank">this link</a>
  to see if you have been invited to any session. When grooming, you
  don't have to provide a number of points for every issue (or even
  most) - put '?' if you don't feel you have enough knowledge to
  estimate a task.
