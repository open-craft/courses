<p>
  As a newcomer you should:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Not commit to more than
    <strong>3 points</strong>
    of tasks during your first week, or 5 points your second week.
    (It's really easy to over-commit at first, so keep your commitments manageable.
    If you finish early you can always ask in the
    <a href="https://chat.opencraft.com/opencraft/channels/sprint-planning"><em>Sprint planning</em></a>
    channel whether someone needs any help,
    and take on more work later in the sprint).
  </li>
  <li>
    Provide lots of updates to your assigned reviewer/mentor for each task,
    so they can provide timely help.
  </li>
</ol>
