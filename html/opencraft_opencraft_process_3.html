<h4>Detailed version</h4>

<h5>All Roles</h5>
<ul>
  <li>
    In general, "work from the right" - it's better to finish a task that's already in progress than it is to start a whole new task. This reduces context switching, which will help get things done more quickly. With that said, if you are blocked on a task, move on to another task, until unblocked.
  </li>
  <li>
    Daily, use the Tempo time tracking on the Jira board to record the time spent on each task and update each ticket being worked on once finished on it for the day. Even just a quick summary or sentence of where you're at with the task is useful to your reviewer.
  </li>
</ul>

<h5>Developer Team</h5>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      All tasks are split up into epics, and the epics are also assigned to specific "subteams".
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      By Monday at 11am UTC, the epic subteam owner will make sure each story
      in the upcoming sprint is "groomed". This means that we each estimate
      the complexity of each task in terms of "story points".
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The subteam owner can decide how the grooming should work,
        but it usually involves everyone in the subteam using
        the asynchronous grooming tool we have built in to JIRA. Grooming invites
        should be sent out as early as possible on Friday to ensure
        everyone can participate before the deadline.
      </li>
      <li>
        We use story points as a shorthand for agreeing about the complexity of a task.
        Story points are meant to be a relatively objective measure of "complexity",
        and not necessarily indicate how long it would take any particular developer to do.
      </li>
      <li>
        We use a fibonacci scale for story points (please see <a href="https://github.com/open-craft/documentation/blob/master/task_workflows.md" target="_blank">task workflows</a> for more detail on story points for different types of tasks).
      </li>
      <li>
        If anything about the task or the acceptance criteria is unclear,
        post a question as a comment on the task and try to work with the epic owner
        to get it answered before the meeting. (If there is no epic owner assigned yet,
        ask the subteam owner.)
        <br />
        Note that during the asynchronous grooming sessions, any comments/questions
        posted in the estimation session will be lost once the grooming session ends,
        so it's preferable to post questions on the tickets themselves.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Likewise, before the Monday planning meeting, everyone in each subteam works
      to asynchronously assign each story in the upcoming sprint to a developer
      and a code reviewer.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The subteam owner is responsible for making sure this happens.
      </li>
      <li>
        The subteam owner should also check the weekly time allocation
        for the upcoming sprints, ensuring subteam members are assigned to tasks
        roughly corresponding to their subteam time allocations,
        that the necessary work to match deadlines is included in the upcoming sprints,
        and that all tasks from their subteam that are above the line
        (and perhaps some below the line) in the upcoming sprint have a green checkmark.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      We have a meeting on Monday via Google Hangouts. There we review the grooming and assignments for the upcoming sprint (please see the <a href="https://github.com/open-craft/documentation/blob/master/sprint_planning_agenda.md" target="_blank">sprint planning agenda</a> for details of this meeting)
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If you don't see the meetings as recurring events on your calendar,
        ask Xavier to send you the invitation.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      After the sprint has been planned and started, it's time to code!
      In your first sprint you'll find your first technical task assigned to you
      by CTO. In the next regular sprints:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Take a look at the <a href="https://tasks.opencraft.com/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=5" target="_blank">current sprint board</a>. There are filters at the top such as <em>My Issues</em>, <em>My code reviews</em>, and your name, which can be toggled to show only issues relevant to you.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drag a task from column to column on the sprint board to update its status
        as you work through it. The various statuses/columns are described below.
        Tasks move from left to right until completion.
      </li>
      <li>
        In general, "work from the right" - it's better to finish a task
        that's already in progress than it is to start a whole new task.
        This reduces context switching, which will help get things done more quickly;
        it also demonstrates reactivity to upstream reviewers
        (which pushes them to be reactive too).
      </li>
      <li>
        Use the Tempo timekeeping system built into our JIRA board
        for tracking the time you spend on each task.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5>Admin Team</h5>
<ul>
  <li>
    Xavier will add task to your board for the week every Monday (or you can add your own tasks). Drag a task from column to column on the sprint board to update its status as you work through it. The various statuses/columns are described below. Tasks move from left to right until completion.
  </li>
  <li>
    Micro communicate. Include links, screenshots, any useful reference when asking questions, commenting, updating on a ticket or any other platform where you're synching with another team member (docs, sheets, Mattermost, emails, etc).
  </li>
  <li>
    Research and seek out resources for any questions you might have that can be solved this way. Any questions for the team or or reviewer, always ask in clear detail. Limit meetings to an absolute minimum.
  </li>
  <li>
    Monitor emails for anything you can un-block for the team, client emails to forward and / or answer, instance performance issues or billing questions / notifications.
  </li>
  <li>
    Work proactively and create and maintain any useful documents needed for record keeping or instructions (this can be anything from a how-to or a FAQ). Make sure to keep anything private that relates to billing and accounting.
  </li>
</ul>
