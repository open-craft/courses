 A Google Apps email of the format
 <code>
  your-first-name@opencraft.com
 </code>
 has been setup for each team member. You should have received an email with a
 link to the login page and a temporary password. This Google Apps account will
 also give you access to Google Calendar, Google Drive, Google Hangouts, and
 more. When working on OpenCraft projects, please use these Google apps that are
 provided by the OpenCraft account rather than, say, your personal Gmail or
 Google Calendar.

 Let's configure your OpenCraft e-mail!
